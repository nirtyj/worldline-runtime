"""The contract between a runtime (the harness) and a brain (the model).

The runtime owns the robot, the clock, belief, rules, cancellation and
speech. The brain owns interpretation and choosing the next step. In the
playground the brain is brains/composite.py around the planner (agent/model.py),
which does both.

    kind = await brain.classify(utterance, ctx)    # one of KINDS
    call = await brain.next_action(ctx)            # a ToolCall

The runtime decides what a kind means (only a correction, or a request System 1
confidently marks replaces_task, cancels anything; "stop" never waits for the
model), executes tool calls under its rules, and
records every action -- the brain's and its own, such as verification looks --
as a HistoryEntry.

``ToolCall.tag`` is opaque bookkeeping: copy it into the HistoryEntry
unchanged. Model brains leave it None.
