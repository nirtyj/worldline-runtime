"""System 1: Gemini 3.8 Live, always on. The robot's fast attention.

Two Live sessions, so that labelling a message never waits on vision:

    router     text only: the fused state, what the robot says, and every message you
               type (stop included). Answers each message with one route call:
               route(kind, target, replaces_task, says_yes, confidence).
    observer   the fused state and the head-camera frames the frame gate lets through.
               Answers "what did you notice?" with one observe call: observe(items).

The runtime decides what a label means and what an observation is worth: a label
is applied only when it is valid and confident enough, otherwise the planner
classifies; an observation enters belief as an unverified hint. System 1 never
speaks and has no robot tools.

    s1 = SystemOne(api_key, on_status)
    asyncio.create_task(s1.run())                 # keeps both sessions open, reconnects
    await s1.update(context_dict)                 # the fused state, when it changes
    await s1.frame(jpeg, "kitchen_counter_1a")    # a frame worth seeing
    await s1.robot_said("On my way.")
    route = await s1.route("Bring me the mug.")   # -> dict, or None if unsure, slow or down
    items = await s1.observe()                    # -> [{"what", "where", "confidence"}]

Plug it into the server with SYSTEM1=brains.system1:create (reads GEMINI_API_KEY,
and SYSTEM1_MODEL to override the model).

Why it's built this way (measured on gemini-3.8-live, 12 messages per setup):
- Latency grows with a session's context: a route took 0.7 s with 2k tokens, 1.4-2.8 s
  at 6k and 2.6 s at 15k, i.e. past the 2 s budget after a few minutes of frames. So
  routing has its own text-only session (about 1-2k tokens), and each session starts
  over (between questions, with the latest state restored) once its context passes a
  limit. A small sliding window was tried first; the server rejected the trimmed
  session ("1007 invalid argument").
- Tool replies are SILENT (and the tools declared NON_BLOCKING, 3.8 Live's default):
  otherwise the model reacts to each reply, and the next message waits behind that.
  Median 1.00 s -> 0.60 s; p90 1.16 s -> 0.7-0.9 s.
- Messages go in with send_client_content, not send_realtime_input: realtime text
  was slower here (1.19 s median), and client content keeps the order of state,
  robot lines and messages.
- Each question is numbered ("USER #7: ...") and the call must echo the number, so a
  late call for an earlier message is never taken as the label of a newer one. If the
  model talks instead of calling, the caller gets its fallback when that turn ends.
- gemini-3.8-live doesn't take a thinking level and only answers in audio (TEXT is
  rejected); the audio is never played. gemini-3.1-flash-live-preview routed the same
  12 messages about 0.15 s faster (SYSTEM1_MODEL=gemini-3.1-flash-live-preview).

  says_yes       "yes" or "no" when the message answers a yes/no question the robot just asked \

  confidence     0 to 1: how sure you are of the kind. Below 0.5 the planner decides instead, \
so give a low number when a message could be read two ways.

A reply to a question the robot just asked is kind answer, even when it sounds like a command \
("have a look", "go check", "the kitchen"). STATE and ROBOT SAID are context: never call route \
for them and never reply to them. Never answer the user and never speak: your audio is never \
